`check-datapackage` is a Python package that checks your Data Package’s
metadata against the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/),
to ensure that it's compliant with the standard.
Specifically, it:

- Checks your metadata in `datapackage.json` against the Data Package
  standard.
- Enables you to configure which components of the metadata should or
  should not be checked.
- Enables you to turn off specific checks defined in the standard.
- Supports user-defined, custom checks.
- Provides clear and user-friendly messages that point directly to where
  issues occur in the metadata.
- Supports a strict mode that enforces full compliance with the
  standard, including properties that must and should be included.

⚠️ Note that `check-datapackage` only checks the metadata in your datapackage.json file against the Data Package standard—it does not check the data itself against the metadata.
