`check-datapackage` is a Python package that checks your Data Package's
metadata against the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/),
to ensure that your metadata is compliant with the standard.

## Key features :sparkles:

-   Checks your metadata in `datapackage.json` against the Data Package
    standard.
-   Enables you to configure which components of the metadata should or
    should not be checked.
-   Enables you to turn off specific checks defined in the standard.
-   Supports user-defined, custom checks.
-   Provides clear and user-friendly messages that point directly to
    where issues occur in the metadata.
-   Supports a strict mode that enforces full compliance with the
    standard, including not only the checks defined by the Data Package specification as "MUST" but also those marked as "SHOULD".

:warning: Note that `check-datapackage` only checks the metadata in your
`datapackage.json` file against the Data Package standard---it does not
check the data itself against the metadata.
