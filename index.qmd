`check-datapackage` is a Python package that checks your Data Package's
metadata against the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/),
helping you ensure that your metadata is both correct and compliant.

## Key features :sparkles:

-   Checks the
    [descriptor](https://datapackage.org/standard/glossary/#descriptor)
    in your `datapackage.json` against the Data Package standard.
-   Enables you to configure which components of the descriptor that
    should or should not be checked.
-   Supports user-defined, custom checks.
-   Provides clear and user-friendly messages that point directly to
    where issues occur in the descriptor.
-   Supports a strict mode that enforces full compliance with the
    standard, including all recommended fields.

:warning: Note that `check-datapackage` only checks the descriptor
against the Data Package standard---it does not check the data itself
against its descriptor.

## About the Seedcase Project

`check-datapackage` is part of the [**Seedcase
Project**](https://seedcase-project.org), which helps research projects
manage and process data in line with the
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles.

This package works as a standalone tool but is also integrated in
[Seedcase Sprout](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org), a Python package
that provides a framework for growing structured, organised, and FAIR
