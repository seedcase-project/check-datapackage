## The `Issue` class

One `Issue` corresponds to one failed check on one field in the
properties. An `Issue` has attributes that provide information about the
failed check, which are described in more detail in the
[`Issue`](/docs/reference/Issue.qmd) documentation.

## The `explain()` function

The `explain()` function provides a more verbose and user-friendly
description of a list of `Issue`s. If you have package properties that
looks like the below, with the missing `resources` field (that we remove
here to demonstrate the `explain()` function):

```{python}
import check_datapackage as cdp
package_properties = cdp.example_package_properties()
del package_properties["resources"]
package_properties
```

You can give the issues found by `check()` to `explain()` to get a more
human-friendly version of the problems:

```{python}
#| eval: false
issues = cdp.check(properties=package_properties)
cdp.explain(issues)
```

When setting `error=True` in `check()`, error messages will be generated
by the `explain()` function.
