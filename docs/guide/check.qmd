The purpose of `check-datapackage` is to make sure a Data Package's
metadata---stored in its `datapackage.json` file---complies with the
[Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org). This standard defines
the available properties at each level of the `datapackage.json`, which
ones are required, and what values are allowed.

This guide shows you how to use the main function
[`check()`](/docs/reference/check.qmd) to run these checks. Each section
walks you through a different part of `check()`, starting with its basic
usage with the `properties` argument, introducing the default checks,
how to configure which checks you want to run with the `config`
argument, and how to handle failed checks with the `error` argument.

documentation](/docs/reference/check.qmd).

## Getting started with `check()` (`properties`)

[`check()`](/docs/reference/check.qmd) checks a Data Package's metadata
against the Data Package standard and reports any issues it finds.

It requires one main input, `properties`, which is a Python `dict`
representing the properties in the `datapackage.json` file. You can load
these properties from the JSON file using the helper function
[`read_json()`](/docs/reference/read_json.qmd) included in
`check-datapackage`.

By default, if any issues are found, `check()` returns a list of `Issue`
objects---each one describing a failed check on a property. If no issues
are found, `check()` returns an empty list. If you'd rather have the
function give an error if it finds any issues, see the [Stop program on
failed checks (`error=True`)](#stop-program-on-failed-checks-errortrue)
section below.

Let's look at an example. The code below defines a `package_properties`
dictionary that includes all the required properties in a correct
format. The example looks like this (from the
[`example_package_properties()`](/docs/reference/example_package_properties.qmd):

```{python}
import check_datapackage as cdp
import pprint


package_properties = cdp.example_package_properties()
pprint.pp(package_properties)
```

When we call `check()` on these properties, it returns an empty list:

```{python}
cdp.check(properties=package_properties)
```

Now let's edit `package_properties` to have a `name` of the wrong type
(a number instead of a string) and run `check()` again:

```{python}
package_properties["name"] = 123

cdp.check(properties=package_properties)
```

The output now lists one `Issue` for the `name` field being of the
wrong type.

## Default checks and configuration (`config`)

By default, `check()` runs the standard checks defined as `MUST`s in the
Data Package standard. These include checking that all required
properties are present and that their values have the correct types and
formats. This happens through a default
[`Config`](/docs/reference/Config.qmd) object passed to the `config`
argument of `check()`.

If you want to configure which checks are performed, you can provide
your own `Config` object in `check()`. With this object you can exclude
certain checks, include additional `SHOULD` recommendations from the
Data Package standard, or add your own custom checks.

checks](config.qmd) guide or the [`Config` reference
documentation](/docs/reference/Config.qmd).
:::

## Stop program on failed checks (`error=True`) {#stop-program-on-failed-checks-errortrue}

If you want failed checks to result in errors and terminate program
execution, you can achieve this by setting the `error` argument of
`check()` to `True`. Using the same incorrect `package_properties`
example as before, we can call `check()` with `error=True` like this:

```{python}
#| error: true
cdp.check(properties=package_properties, error=True)
```

Since some checks failed, the function now raises an error rather than
returning the list of issues.
