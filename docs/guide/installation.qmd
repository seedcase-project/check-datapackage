Before installing `check-datapackage`, you need to have
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/) installed.

To check that these programs are installed, run the following commands
in your Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 --version
pipx --version
```

If Python and pipx are installed, these commands will show you the
versions installed on your system. If you get an error, you need to
install them before continuing.

## Install in a project (recommended)

It's generally recommended to install Python packages in a project's
virtual environment to keep the project's dependencies isolated from the
system-wide Python setup and avoid conflicts. There are several tools to
manage package dependencies and create virtual environments, such as
venv, virtualenv, and uv. For this guide, we will use
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

If you don't have uv installed, you can install it in your Terminal with
pipx:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx install uv
```

To check that uv is installed, run this command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv
```

If you get a list of uv commands, you've installed it successfully.
With uv installed, you can now install `check-datapackage` directly from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/seedcase-project/check-datapackage):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv add check-datapackage
```

You can check that `check-datapackage` has been installed correctly by
running this command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv pip show check_datapackage
```

If `check-datapackage` has been installed successfully, the output will
show details about `check-datapackage`.

## Install system-wide

We strongly recommend using `check-datapackage` in a virtual
environment, but you can also install it system-wide. The easiest way to
do that is to use pipx:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx install check-datapackage
```

To check that `check-datapackage` has been installed correctly, run the
following and make sure `check_datapackage` is listed:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
pipx list
```

Now you can use `check-datapackage` in any Python script on your
computer.
