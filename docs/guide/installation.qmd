Before installing `check-datapackage`, you need to have
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

To check that these programs are installed, run the following commands
in your Terminal:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
python3 --version
uv --version
```

If Python and uv are installed, these commands will show you the
versions installed on your system. If you get an error, you need to
install them before continuing.

## Install `check-datapackage` in a Python project

It's generally recommended to install Python packages in a project's
virtual environment to keep the project's dependencies isolated from the
system-wide Python setup and avoid conflicts. We use (and recommend)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

We assume you've already created a Python project that has a
`pyproject.toml` file. If not, review uv's guide on making
[projects](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/).

While in the Terminal and in the project's directory, add
`check-datapackage` to your project's virtual environment by running:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv add "check-datapackage @ git+https://github.com/seedcase-project/check-datapackage"
```

<!-- TODO: Change to `uv add check-datapackage` when we've released it on PyPI -->

You can check that `check-datapackage` has been installed correctly by
running this command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
uv pip show check-datapackage
```

If `check-datapackage` has been installed successfully, the output will
show details about `check-datapackage`.
