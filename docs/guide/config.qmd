You can pass a `Config` object to `check()` to customise the checks done
on the descriptor. The following configuration options are available:

-   `version`: The version of Data Package standard to check against.
    Defaults to `v2`.
-   `exclude`: The list of checks to exclude.
-   `custom_checks`: The list of custom checks to run in addition to the
    checks defined in the standard.
-   `strict`: Whether to run recommended checks in addition to required
    ones. Defaults to `False`.

## Excluding checks

You can exclude checks based on their `type` and the fields they apply
to.

The Data Package standard defines a range of check types (e.g.,
`required` or `pattern`) and it is also possible to create your own. For
example, to exclude checks flagging missing fields, you would exclude
the `required` check by defining an `Exclude` object with this `type`:

```{python}
from textwrap import dedent
import check_datapackage as cdp

exclude_required = cdp.Exclude(type="required")
```

To exclude checks of a specific field or fields, you can use a [JSON
path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath) in the `jsonpath`
attribute of an `Exclude` object. For example, you can exclude all
checks on the `name` field of the Data Package descriptor by writing:

```{python}
exclude_name = cdp.Exclude(jsonpath="$.name")
```

Or you can use the wildcard JSON path selector to exclude checks on the
`path` field of **all** Data Resource descriptors:

```{python}
exclude_path = cdp.Exclude(jsonpath="$.resources[*].path")
```

The `type` and `jsonpath` arguments can also be combined:

```{python}
exclude_desc_required = cdp.Exclude(type="required", jsonpath="$.resources[*].description")
```

This would exclude required checks on the `description` field of Data
Resource descriptors.

To make the `check()` function aware of your exclusions, you add them to
the `Config` object passed to the function:

```{python}
package_descriptor = {
    "name": 123,
    "title": "Hibernation Physiology of the Woolly Dormouse: A Scoping Review.",
    "id": "123-abc-123",
    "created": "2014-05-14T05:00:01+00:00",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "licenses": [{"name": "odc-pddl"}],
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "woolly-dormice-2015",
            "title": "Body fat percentage in the hibernating woolly dormouse",
            "path": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_dormouse",
        }
    ],
}

config = cdp.Config(exclude=[exclude_required, exclude_name, exclude_path])
issues = cdp.check(descriptor=package_descriptor, config=config)
print(issues)
```

In the example above, we would expect four `Issue` items: the package
`name` is a number, the required `description` field is missing in both
the package and resource properties, and the resource `path` doesn't
point to a data file. However, as we have defined exclusions for all of
these, the function will flag no issues.

## Adding custom checks

It is possible to create custom checks in addition to the ones defined
in the Data Package standard.

Let's say your organisation only accepts Data Packages licensed under
MIT. You can express this requirement in a `CustomCheck` as follows:

```{python}
license_check = cdp.CustomCheck(
    type="only-mit",
    jsonpath="$.licenses[*].name",
    message=dedent("""
        Data Packages may only be licensed under MIT. Please review
        the licenses listed in the Data Package.
        """),
    check=lambda license_name: license_name == "mit",
)
```

Here's a breakdown of what each argument does:

-   `type`: An identifier for your custom check. This is what will show
    up in error messages and what you will use if you want to exclude
    your check. Each `CustomCheck` should have a unique `type`.
-   `jsonpath`: The location of the field or fields the custom check
    applies to, expressed in [JSON
    path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath) notation. This check
    applies to the `name` field of all package licenses.
-   `message`: The message that is shown when the check is violated.
-   `check`: A function that expresses the custom check. It takes the
    value at the `jsonpath` location as input and returns true if the
    check is met, false if it isn't.

To register your custom checks with the `check()` function, you add them
to the `Config` object passed to the function:

```{python}
package_descriptor = {
    "name": "woolly-dormice",
    "title": "Hibernation Physiology of the Woolly Dormouse: A Scoping Review.",
    "description": dedent("""
        This scoping review explores the hibernation physiology of the
        woolly dormouse, drawing on data collected over a 10-year period
        along the Taurus Mountain range in Turkey.
        """),
    "id": "123-abc-123",
    "created": "2014-05-14T05:00:01+00:00",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "licenses": [{"name": "odc-pddl"}, {"name": "mit"}],
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "woolly-dormice-2015",
            "title": "Body fat percentage in the hibernating woolly dormouse",
            "path": "resources/woolly-dormice-2015/data.parquet",
        }
    ],
}

config = cdp.Config(custom_checks=[license_check])
issues = cdp.check(descriptor=package_descriptor, config=config)
print(issues)
```

We can see that the custom check was applied: `check()` returned one
issue flagging the first license attached to the Data Package.

## Strict mode

The Data Package standard has both requirements and recommendations. By
default, `check()` only checks requirements. Recommendations can be
turned on by setting the `strict` argument to `True`. The example below
violates the recommendation that the package `name` should contain no
special characters.

```{python}
package_descriptor = {
    "name": "Woolly Dormice (Toros Dağları)",
    "title": "Hibernation Physiology of the Woolly Dormouse: A Scoping Review.",
    "description": dedent("""
        This scoping review explores the hibernation physiology of the
        woolly dormouse, drawing on data collected over a 10-year period
        along the Taurus Mountain range in Turkey.
        """),
    "id": "123-abc-123",
    "created": "2014-05-14T05:00:01+00:00",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "licenses": [{"name": "odc-pddl"}],
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "woolly-dormice-2015",
            "title": "Body fat percentage in the hibernating woolly dormouse",
            "path": "resources/woolly-dormice-2015/data.parquet",
        }
    ],
}

issues = cdp.check(descriptor=package_descriptor, strict=True)
print(issues)
```
