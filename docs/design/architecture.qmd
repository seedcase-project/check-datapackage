title: "Architecture"
---

This documentation contains the architectural designs for
`check-datapackage`. For design details on Seedcase as a whole, see the
[Design](https://design.seedcase-project.org) documentation.

The purpose of these architectural documents is to describe to ourselves
and others what `check-datapackage` aims to accomplish and how it will
do that.

# User types {#user-types}

This section describes the different users we expect and design for.

-   **Owner:** Creates and owns the Data Package. Wants to ensure that
    the Data Package is correct, at least at the level of the
    properties.
-   **Manager:** Manages and edits the properties within the Data
    Package. Wants to make sure that whenever changes are made to the
    properties (e.g., updating the description field), they remain
    compliant with the standard.
-   **Developer:** Contributes to building up the Data Package or the
    infrastructure around it. Wants to ensure that changes don't impact
    the correctness of the Data Package descriptor.

# Inputs

This section describes the inputs accepted by `check-datapackage`.

-   **Descriptor:** This is a Python dictionary containing the
    properties of a Data Package or Data Resource. Allowed properties
    are defined in the [Data Package
    standard](https://datapackage.org/). A common use case is loading
    the descriptor from the `datapackage.json` file.
-   **Config:** A `Config` object can optionally be passed to
    `check-datapackage` with settings to modify the behaviour and output
    of the check mechanism. See
    [Config](/docs/design/interface.qmd#config) for a more detailed
    description.

# Outputs

For each failed check, `check-datapackage` flags the corresponding issue
in the descriptor. If all checks pass, no output is produced.

-   Default mode: The issues are returned as a list without stopping
    program execution.
-   Error mode: The issues are raised as an error stopping program
    execution.

# C4 Models

This section contains the [C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) for
`check-datapackage`. The C4 Model is an established visualisation
approach to describe the architecture of a software system. It breaks
the system down into four levels of architectural abstraction: Context,
Containers, Components, and Code. For our case, the **Context** and
**Containers** diagrams are the most useful.

## Context

The Context diagram shows the users and any external systems that
interact with `check-datapackage`. This includes the user types
described in the [User types](#user-types) section.

For some reason, these diagrams don't display well on some browsers like
Firefox. To see them, try using a different browser like Chrome or Edge.

    user_developer --> check
```

## Container

The Container diagram shows the larger parts of the system, what they
are responsible for, and how they interact with each other. It also
shows the technology choices for each container.

	check
	
	config --> check
	ext_dp_schema --> check
	in_dp_json --> check
```

# Naming

This section contains a naming scheme for `check-datapackage` that is
guided by our [style guide](https://design.seedcase-project.org/style/)
and the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/).

Following Data Package terminology, we simplify "data package" to
"package" and "data resource" to "resource". The Data Package standard
calls package and resource metadata contained in the `datapackage.json`
file
["descriptors"](https://datapackage.org/standard/glossary/#descriptor).
We adopt this usage, but may also use the words "property" or
"properties" to refer to metadata.

## Objects

| Object | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| package | A data package that contains a collection of related data resources and properties. |
| resource | A single data file within a package including its properties. |
| descriptor | Metadata about a package or resource. |
| properties | Metadata about a package or resource. |
| standard | The JSON schema defining the Data Package standard. |
| config | An object containing settings for modifying the behaviour and output of the check mechanism. |

: Objects used throughout `check-datapackage`.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| check | Check that a descriptor conforms to the Data Package standard. |
| explain | Explain issues flagged by the check mechanism in more detail using non-technical language. |

: Actions that `check-datapackage` can perform.
