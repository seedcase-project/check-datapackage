title: "Design"
---

The purpose of these documents is to describe the design of `check-datapackage` in enough detail to help us develop it in a way that is sustainable (i.e., maintainable over the long term) and that ensures we as a team have a shared understanding of what the package is and is not.

`check-datapackage`'s design builds off of our overall Seedcase [design principles and patterns](https://design.seedcase-project.org/), in that any design we create for `check-datapackage` should strongly follow the same design principles and patterns described there.

## Purpose

The overall aim of `check-datapackage` is to check the correctness and compliance of Data Package descriptors (i.e., the contents of `datapackage.json`) against the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/).

Specifically, `check-datapackage` should:

1.  Check that the structure and contents of Data Package descriptors match the specification.
2.  Provide simple, user-friendly feedback about mismatches.

## Requirements

Overall, `check-datapackage` must:

-   Check Data Package descriptors against the Data Package standard.
-   Allow configuration to check or not check certain components of the descriptor.
-   Support turning off specific checks defined in the standard.
-   Support custom, user-defined checks in addition to those in the standard.
-   Provide informative, user-friendly, and structured messages about any issues.
-   Identify where in the descriptor the issues occur.

In general, `check-datapackage` will not:

-   Depend on other Seedcase packages.
-   Check resource data against its descriptor.
