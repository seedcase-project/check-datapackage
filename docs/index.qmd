## What is `check-datapackage`?

`check-datapackage` is a simple Python package that is designed to do
one thing: check a [Data Package](https://datapackage.org), as described
in a `datapackage.json` file, for compliance with the [Data Package
specification](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/).

## Why use it?

The [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), who initially
started and developed the Data Package specification, has several tools
(listed [here](https://frictionlessdata.io/universe/) and
[here](https://datapackage.org/overview/software/)) for working with
Data Packages, including a Python package called
[`frictionless`](https://pypi.org/project/frictionless/). However, the
`frictionless` package is a large package that does many things, and it
can be difficult to navigate the documentation and interface to find and
use the specific functionality you need. There are many other issues
with it, the biggest of which is that it still implements Data Package
version 1, while the latest is version 2.

So we built this package. We wanted a small, well-designed, and
easy-to-use package that only checks the compliance of a Data Package
against the current standard. We wanted one that can be extended to
support using it as a CLI (in the future), for instance using it as
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook or in CI pipelines like
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
