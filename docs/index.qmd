## What is `check-datapackage`?

`check-datapackage` is a simple Python package that checks your [Data
Package's](https://datapackage.org) `datapackage.json` file for
compliance with the [Data Package
specification](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/).

## Why use it?

The [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), who initially
started and developed the Data Package specification, has several tools
(listed on the [Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/universe/) and
[Data Package](https://datapackage.org/overview/software/) websites) for
working with Data Packages, including a Python package called
[`frictionless`](https://pypi.org/project/frictionless/). However, the
`frictionless` package is a large package that does many things, and it
can be difficult to navigate the documentation and interface to find and
use the specific functionality you need. It also still implements Data
Package version 1, while the latest is version 2.

Since we found ourselves missing a tool we needed for our project, the
[Seedcase Project](https://github.com/seedcase-project), we decided to
build this package. We wanted a small, well-designed, and easy-to-use
package that only checks the compliance of a Data Package against the
current standard. We designed it for future CLI support, for instance
using it in a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook or in CI
pipelines like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
