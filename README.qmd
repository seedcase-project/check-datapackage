# {{< meta gh.repo >}}: Ensure the compliance of your Data Package metadata

{{< include /docs/includes/_badges.qmd >}}

`check-datapackage` is a Python package that checks your Data Package's
metadata against the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/)
to ensure that it's compliant with the standard. Specifically, it:

-   Checks your metadata in `datapackage.json` against the Data Package
    standard.
-   Enables you to configure which components of the metadata should or
    should not be checked.
-   Enables you to turn off specific checks defined in the standard.
-   Supports user-defined, custom checks.
-   Provides clear and user-friendly messages that point directly to
    where issues occur in the metadata.
-   Supports a strict mode that enforces full compliance with the
    standard, including properties that must and should be included.

::: callout-warning
`check-datapackage` only checks the metadata in your `datapackage.json`
file against the Data Package standard---it does not check the data
itself against the metadata.

::: callout-tip
This Python package was generated from the
[`template-python-package`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/template-python-package)
Seedcase template :tada:
